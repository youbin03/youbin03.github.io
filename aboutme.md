# About Me #

Hello, my name is Youbin Park and I am a Junior studying Molecular & Cell Biology at University of Pennsylvania.
I am on Pre-med track and would like to become a physician in the future.
I am involved in various clubs around the campus including Alzheimer's Buddies, Phi Delta Epsilon, and Koreans at Penn.
