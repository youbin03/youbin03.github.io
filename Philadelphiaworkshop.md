Last week, I had a meaningful experience at the Iffy Books, learning how to record music from my phone to the cassette tape with the cassette player. Learning how to use the cassette player was not a difficult task. Unlike the classic cassette player, the cassette player (QFX RETRO-39) had a Bluetooth function where I could connect my phone audio to the player and use it as a Bluetooth speaker. I had to be aware that when I wanted to record the playlist from my phone, I had to have the cassette player in Bluetooth mode to project the sound from my phone to record. However, when I wanted to hear the recorded version on the tape, I had to switch the mode to the tape mode. The owner of the Iffy Books also explained that the cassette tape has two sides, Side A and B, and both sides can be used to record two distinct playlists. Each side could record 180 minutes and in total, one cassette tape can record about a 6 hours long playlist. The basic science principle behind the cassette tape was that tape is a plastic film coated with a magnetic material. As the sound is played through the speaker and the tape passes through the magnetic head, the magnetic particles on the tape orient according to the direction and strength of the magnetic field produced by the sound. When the tape is rewinded and played again, it will play back the recorded sound, showing how the sound can be stored as data in the cassette tape. Using this knowledge, I played my favorite song “Don’t Look Back in Anger” by Oasis using the Bluetooth function on the cassette player while pressing the recording button at the beginning of the music. When the song ended, I rewinded the tape and switched the speaker mode to tape mode to play the sound recorded on the music tape.

As I learned more about the cassette through the workshop, I saw a connection between the practice with one of the class readings, “The Hidden Stories in the U.S. Census and How to Read Them” by Dan Bouk. Bouk begins his writing by claiming that “there are stories in the data.” (Bouk, 3). He claims that when we have to read and interpret the data, we must widen our lens and look into the processes involved in storing the data. This statement applies to the cassette tape, one of the ways to store the data. When I was recording my favorite music into the tape, I was not just recording a sound; behind the data, there was a song selection process, learning how to use the cassette player, and physically holding down the record button for 3 minutes to store the data. Through these processes, new memories were generated which I could recall back to when playing the cassette tape once again. However, to a random stranger playing the cassette tape, all my learning processes, purposes, and memories behind the cassette tape would be lost. In that way, the person will “come away with an incomplete, possibly distorted picture” (Bouk, 19) of the cassette, reminding us of the importance of looking beyond the data for the stories that data also records. In addition, Bouk also claims that “data set is a text” (Bouk, 13) as it has different authors, takes up space in the form of objects, and belongs to an old tradition. In the playlist that I made in the workshop, the authors include myself as well as the owner of the Iffy books who taught how to use the tape, as well as the artists to the songs that are recorded in the tape. The song playlist, the dataset in this case, was stored in the form of cassette tape, a tangible object. Most importantly, recording the music belongs to the old tradition of writing sheet music, which has evolved to cassette tape, then into the digital form of mp3 files. Just like how the old Big Data of the 1940 Census “paved the way for the use of modern statistical sampling methods” (Bouk 6), the cassette tape, now an old way of recording sound, gave ideas and techniques for the modern mp3 files. 

In conclusion, the cassette workshop allowed me to learn more about the music recording method and walk away with valuable memories. Through the workshop, I learned the limitations of storing the data as well as how the data set is a “text”.
