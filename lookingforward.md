# Looking forward
Inspired by the Printing in Prisons project and connecting to my future goal of becoming a physician, I would like to research the medical facilities that existed in the Eastern State Penitentiary and the impact that they had on the inmates. I would like to compare and contrast the medical facilities found in historical prisons around the world and collect data to be presented in the blog post. Three concrete steps that I would like to take are:

**Data Collection on Medical Facilities in Prison:** On our last visit to Eastern State Penitentiary, I did not have time to visit the medical wing. I would like to revisit the prison and take a deep look at the medical wing to research more about the medical practices that were done. Also, I would try to research published papers or articles that discuss medicine in prisons and organize them into digitized data for easy access and readability.

**Take Penn classes related to the project:** As mentioned in my statement, I faced several limitations in designing a website as I never had any coding experience. I would like to take an introductory computer science class to learn more about coding that I could utilize in the future for website creation. Also, in order to learn more about the role of medicine in history, I would like to take the “Medicine in History” course offered at Penn to understand medicine’s complex role in society.

**Design a blog post about medicine in prison through Github:** With the experience with Github from COML class and new learning from the computer science class, I would like to design a more professional blog post about this research topic. Similar to the blog post for this class, I would like to add an interactivity component to the blog post for the users to interact and form relationships with the data. I would also like to include a detailed analysis of the roles that medical facilities played in the prison and their legacies now.
